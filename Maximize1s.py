# Given a binary array arr[] containing only 0s and 1s and an integer k, you are allowed to flip at most k 0s to 1s. 
# Find the maximum number of consecutive 1's that can be obtained in the array after performing the operation at most k times.

# Examples:

# Input: arr[] = [1, 0, 1], k = 1
# Output: 3
# Explanation: By flipping the zero at index 1, we get the longest subarray from index 0 to 2 containing all 1â€™s.
