Welcome to my Geeks-for-Geeks Daily Learning Repository!

This repo contains everything I solve and learn on GFG on a daily basis —
including POTD, topic-wise DSA practice, and solutions from the DSA360 Nation SkillUp Program.

I focus on writing clean, optimized, interview-ready code, and I refine older solutions as my understanding grows.

🟩 1. Problem of the Day (POTD)

Daily GFG POTD solutions

Optimized final code

Clean, readable Python solutions

Focus on time & space efficiency

🟧 2. Topic-wise DSA Practice (Everything I Learn on GFG)

Includes practice across major DSA topics:

Arrays

Strings

Queues

Stacks

Linked Lists

Trees & BST

Graphs

Recursion & Backtracking

Dynamic Programming

Greedy Algorithms

Sorting & Searching

Hashing
… and more.

Each folder contains optimized final solutions with improvements over time.

🟦 3. DSA360 – GFG Nation SkillUp Program

A dedicated section for the structured DSA360 path, including:

Daily tasks & assignments

Python implementations

Progress tracking

Topic-wise solutions
